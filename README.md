## Description

An application that I am writing as part of self-development, the assumption of which is to create a system in which users will be able to create accounts together with the choice of a plan. In the basic plan, the application will be a kind of ToDo application, but a bit extensive. In the highest plan, it is supposed to be a project manager like asana or in the future jira.

## Technologies

Some of the technologies used from which the project is created:

* React.js
* Redux-toolkit
* Typescript
* Styled-components
* React-hook-form
* i18n
* raect-testing-library

## Workflow

The main branch is master (change to develop or main). Each task is one branch, which begins with the main branch, branch names are created according to the formula: project abbreviation/task type/task number from asana, for example BM/feature/1202288889962010.

Based on the currently performed work in the project, each major task should be divided into several smaller tasks so that there is regularity in pull requests.

//TODO add changelog file, CI/CD?, Docker?
